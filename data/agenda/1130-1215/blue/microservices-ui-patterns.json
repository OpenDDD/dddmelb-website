  "abstract": "There's a lot of buzz around using Microservices patterns to design your backend system, but surprisingly not a lot of people talk about how these services are ultimately tied back together on the frontend. This talk is about challenges you face when creating a UI for your Microservices and challenges you face to ensure service boundaries are respected while the code is still maintainable and loosely coupled."
