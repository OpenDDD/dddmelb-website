  "abstract": "It's 2017 and everyone's claiming their API is RESTful this, and RESTful that. All REST, all the time.\r\n\r\nI ask them: \"What does REST mean to you?\", they answer excitedly, \"We use Post AS WELL AS Get aaaaand we serialise data to JSON.\" I cry myself to sleep that night.\r\n\r\nCome join me for what may be a talk, a lecture, a rant or possibly even the very public decline in to total madness as we discuss some real world lessons learned about: Why REST is more than just HTTP Verbs. Resource modelling. Why your front-end team will buy you cake if you implement HATEOAS. How to retrofit hypermedia to your existing API, and how does all of this tie together with fancy buzzwords the youth of today are using like \"Microservices\" and \"Backends for Frontends\"."
