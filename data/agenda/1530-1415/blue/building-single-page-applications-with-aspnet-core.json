  "abstract": "In this talk, we'll look at using ASP.NET Core JavaScript Services to build single page applications using Angular, Aurelia, Knockout, React, React+Redux or Vue. Using this approach you can develop on Windows, Mac, or Linux using your preferred source code editor. I'll demonstrate server-side prerendering, webpack dev middleware, hot module replacement (HMR), efficient production builds and much more. You will walk away ready to create single page applications using your favourite client-side framework and ASP.NET Core."
