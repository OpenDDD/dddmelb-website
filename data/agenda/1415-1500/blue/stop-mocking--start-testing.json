  "abstract": "How much value do your automated tests really provide? I will demonstrate common and regular pitfalls in automated testing. Namely, that of mis-defining what a ‘unit' is and disregard for integration tests. Among other things I will also demonstrate how stale tests – be they failing or passing are a problem as well.\r\n\r\nTesting is a good thing, testing a lot for the sake of it is NOT. Stop mocking and actually start testing to provide the highest amount of value in your application with the least amount of code."
