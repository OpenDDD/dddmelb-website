Icons showing unread messages, calling for attention!\r\nHow can you stay on top of all the noise, and still manage to get some coding done? How do you prioritise what messages to respond to? How do you make sure you're not contributing to information overload of your colleagues?\r\nFind out how to manage the distractions inherent in our always-on digital lives, how to communicate more effectively using the tools we all love (and hate), and ultimately communicate in a more meaningful and productive way.\r\n\r\nTO THE MODERATORS: Happy to do this talk as 20 minutes or 45 minutes if it makes a difference to your scheduling"
