  "abstract": "It's 2018 more people are checking social media than watching the 6pm news. YouTube and Netflix are slowly overtaking the popularity of Television. Microsoft acquire for GitHub 7.5B and Mark Zuckerberg has been hit with lawsuits over data misuse. Equifax has arguably had one of the worst data breaches ever.\r\n \r\nIt seems with every growing year data is becoming worth more and more as the risks of data storage has increased. Have you stopped to think about what these companies can do with your data that makes them worth so much? Have you thought about why your privacy matters? Is your data safe or does privacy not exist anymore? \r\n\r\nIn this talk I hope to explore the answers to these questions and uncover some truths to what the potential to data collection could become.  If you're someone who blindly clicks *Accept* on every new privacy policy then you should learn what you've agreed to."
