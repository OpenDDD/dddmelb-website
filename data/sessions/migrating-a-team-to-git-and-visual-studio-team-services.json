  "abstract": "How does a team successfully move from an internally-hosted centralized version control system to Git running in Visual Studio Team Services? Hear how one group of developers did this by taking along the people, adapting their processes, embracing the technology, in a culture open to change.\r\n\r\n• How did we transition the team and learn the new tools and processes?\r\n• What did the team do to maintain version history after the change?\r\n• Do you have to be \"all-in\" on VSTS? Actually, no. Learn how we integrated our other development systems with VSTS\r\n• Why did we want to move, and have we realised those benefits?\r\n• Where to next? Are we satisfied with what we've achieved, or are there new goals to aim for?"
