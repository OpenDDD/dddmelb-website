  "abstract": "It's been 552 days since I had the arguably dumb idea of trying my hand at a startup. Little did I know the sheer volume of learning I'd be doing in the future, from basics like cashflow and forecasts to life lessons like always be talking to new people. \n\nIn this talk I tell the story of how I went from a full time .NET Developer, to a struggling and then mildly successful startup owner. \n\nWe'll explore how I made the transition from full time employment to self-employment; we'll look at many of the mistakes I've made and how to avoid them; and we'll go through some practical tips to get you started on your own startup journey. My first tip? Learn from other people's experiences!"
