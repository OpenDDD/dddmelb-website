  "abstract": "Graphs are a great way to visually show a large amount of data. From dashboard page graphs showing how many people have done the thing, to telecomm websites showing how much data you've used recently. They are everywhere.\nHowever they can be quite challenging to program well, they push the limits of what front end technology can do, as it's much more comfortable showing the data in a table thank you very much!\n\nI'm going to show a way to make graphs on a website a slightly different way then you may have seen in the past. A way that uses a back end language (such as Ruby but could be anything really) to calculate and draw a graph on the front end in an SVG element, using CSS for styling (no JS required). You control all the calculations and where everything goes and how customisable it is.\n\nMy hope is that after this talk that you will feel more confident about making something like this for yourself and also learn a bit about SVG's which you may not have known before."
