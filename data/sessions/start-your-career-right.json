  "abstract": "Starting off your software development career, especially if it's your first career, can be tough. There is so much to learn, more than just syntax of code! This talk, aimed at junior, intermediate or even senior developers(!) covers some of the key tricks to a successful career, such as finding a mentor, working in a team, finding direction, supercharging your learning, getting your performance reviewed and much more. \r\n\r\nThis talk covers a lot of topics, fairly quickly, and so there are many micro-takeaways, but the main takeaway should be “there is more to focus on than just code”. I think attendees would get a lot out of this talk, as it covers topics that people tend to learn the hard way, if at all. However, the knowledge in the topics can be transformative and really supercharge a transition from junior through to senior."
