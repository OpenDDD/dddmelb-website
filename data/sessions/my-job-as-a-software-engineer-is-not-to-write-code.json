  "abstract": "Many software engineers are lead into the false assumption that we are hired to write code.\r\n\r\nThis talk challenges that perception and discusses the real reason we are paid to turn up to work every day.\r\n\r\nMy belief is that it's important for developers to realize that, as it helps inform their decision making."
