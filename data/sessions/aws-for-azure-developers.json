  "abstract": "I did a word count on all the sessions submitted for DDD for the words \"Azure\" and \"AWS\". The count was 65 and 9 respectively. This leads me to thinking that the DDD crowd has more exposure/affinity to Azure than AWS which is the largest public cloud. I have a strong Azure background but the current enterprise I am working is on a AWS journey. This has given me an unique opportunity to compare the two cloud platforms and I would like to share the similarities and differences between the two. It will perhaps allow you to make a decision regarding choosing your cloud provider or at least for Azure developers make yourself aware of AWS."
