  "abstract": "Self-doubt can be a real challenge for software developers, both junior and senior. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you’re not a “real developer”. Join me for a technical talk that is really a story about building courage through problem-solving, finding supporters and claiming the title of software developer.\r\n\r\nKey technical learnings: I talk about the Jackson ObjectMapper, which parses JSON files by mapping them in-memory. I cover some of the limitations of this approach and why it wasn’t well-suited to my project. Then I talk about the Jackson Streaming API, which parses JSON files as a stream of tokens, and the success I had with this approach.\r\n\r\nOther key learnings: Junior software developers have a lot to contribute and should be encouraged to jump in and have a go. Having a supportive team around you is worth more than gold. And if you have an opinion about the best solution to the problem at hand, it’s worth shouting it out.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at junior software developers. It’s a story about taking on a real-life computer science problem and winning."
