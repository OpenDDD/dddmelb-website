  "abstract": "In the near future Machine Learning will underpin every aspect of human-computer interaction. You should be designing new systems with cutting edge Machine Learning capabilities from the ground up. We will explore the implications of ML for the whole team, from user research to development. \n\nGet a grounded perspective on how ML is going to change the way we interact with computers as designers, developers and consumers. Machine Learning First is the next big shift in how we think about designing technology."
