This is a talk about all that code you don't write because it's stupid, it doesn't solve a \"real\" problem or doesn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nWe'll explore some of my own stupid ideas, like writing my own number system in .NET or writing an IoC container in JavaScript, what I learnt from these stupid ideas and why exploring stupidity is important."
