  "abstract": "Developers are generally classified as being introverts by nature. What about you? Are you an introvert? Have you been constantly told to change, to speak up, and be heard to be successful? What if it is against your nature? What if you liked to sit in your quiet corner and let your work do all the talking? Can you still influence people? Can you succeed in a workplace filled with chest thumping extroverts ??\r\n\r\nMany introverts (like Tim Cook) have succeeded in a world filled with extroverts (like Steve Jobs). You could very well be one of them. In this session, Mahesh Krishnan talks about how introverts can leverage on what they are already good at, and use it to their advantage to influence people, and be recognized."
