  "abstract": "What exactly is machine learning? And more importantly, will I understand the answer without doing a Masters and a PhD? Sure!\r\n\r\nJoin me, a fellow AI/ML-newbie, as I walk through what machine learning is, how it can be applied in your applications, and how you can actually create predictive models without accumulating a massive HELP debt in the process.\r\n\r\nWe'll start at the basics by talking about what machine learning can and can't do, but by the end, we'll have a working example of something actually usable. Chock full of examples and a totally non-scary amount of maths, this is the session for you if you're new to ML."
