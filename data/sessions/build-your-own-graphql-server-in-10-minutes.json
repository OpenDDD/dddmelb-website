  "abstract": "GraphQL and its associated frontend libraries like Relay and Apollo Client are now reasonably well known in the industry. However, GraphQL backends are a little less understood. Whilst there are backend-as-a-service platforms available for applications that are entirely green-field, for the rest of us it’s more than likely that, in order to accomodate all of the intricacies of our business domain and infrastructure, we’ll have to build a GraphQL backend ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I’ll show how it's surprisingly easy to get a basic GraphQL backend up-and-running in 10 minutes. After a brief introduction, I'll start the clock and use the Apollo Server framework to build a backend from scratch to service an existing client. Along the way I’ll introduce the concept of GraphQL resolvers and show how you write them, nest and pass data between them, and support both queries and mutations.\r\n\r\nHaving got the basics up and running in 10 minutes, I’ll then close with what the next steps would be for security and performance, and, for those with an aversion to JavaScript, what server frameworks are available for other languages. \r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this presentation with an understanding of the key concepts when building a GraphQL server, and an appreciation of just how easy it can be to get started."
