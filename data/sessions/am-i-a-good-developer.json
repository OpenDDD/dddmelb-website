  "abstract": "\"Am I a Good Developer?\" is a question, I believe, we asked ourselves at least once in our lifetime as developers. In the pursuit of becoming better developers, we try to assess ourselves, but that's not an easy task! \r\n\r\nIn this session I will share with you my views on the questions we should ask ourselves to define what a good developer is, and identify the pitfalls we might fall in the pursuit of becoming one."
