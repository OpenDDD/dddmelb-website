  "abstract": "Close to 1 in 5 Australians have a disability. That’s roughly 4.5 million people. But in the tech world, the people building the products and services often have little or no experience with disability. So how do we make sure we’re creating inclusive experiences that work for all people, no matter their level of ability?\r\n\r\nIn this interactive session, we’ll test out some ‘empathy prompts’ that will bring you one step closer to understanding how disabilities affect people’s experience with technology, and start you on a path towards embedding accessibility into your processes and culture. Bring an open mind."
