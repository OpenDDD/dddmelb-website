  "abstract": "Babies cry a lot and aren’t easily reasoned with (stay with me, I’m going somewhere this this). Occasionally clients can resemble these little humans. However, instead of showing them the same care we fall into the trap of considering their feelings tedious, stupid, or irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThis talk centres on discovering what basic needs clients want met. As Head of Customer Solutions, I have experienced several situations of unhappy clients. Occasionally I handled it well, other times, unfortunately, I didn’t. Learn from my mistakes with this light-hearted take on finding what your clients’ basic needs really are."
