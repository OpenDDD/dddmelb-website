  "abstract": "While microservices are all the rage these days, for many organisations the overhead and complexity required to manage and orchestrate a microservices application doesn’t make sense. But just because you’re not “doing microservices” doesn’t mean you can’t go on the journey to Continuous Delivery! \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss a number of techniques you can use to make your monolith more majestic multiple times per day or week, rather than once or twice a year. \r\n\r\nDrawing on real-world examples, we’ll talk about feature-flags, Platform-as-a-Service, and blue-green deployments as stepping stones to deploying frequently and without downtime. The techniques are applicable to all tech-stacks, but the examples will be .NET-focused."
