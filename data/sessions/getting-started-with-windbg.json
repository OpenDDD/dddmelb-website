This session will focus on how you go from writing a memory dump on a production server to analysing this dump on your machine, explaining each step on the way.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn:\r\n\r\n- How to write a memory dump\r\n- The three key steps guaranteeing you'll be able to issue commands\r\n- How to troubleshoot crash, hangs and memory leaks"
