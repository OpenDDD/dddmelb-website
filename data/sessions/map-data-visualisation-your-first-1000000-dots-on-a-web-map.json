  "abstract": "Making web maps doesn't suck any more. If you know Javascript, you can make high performance, highly interactive map-based data visualisations. You'll learn the absolute bare minimum you need to know about spatial data (not much!), how to get your first dots on a map - and then, how to add a million more. We'll even cover how to self-host your entire spatial data infrastructure, using just two commands. Finally we'll show how to turn plain dots into compelling data visualisation with ridiculously snappy user interaction. We'll use Mapbox-GL-JS, a free, open-source library with excellent documentation, and a couple of related tools."
