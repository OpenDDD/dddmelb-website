  "abstract": "Welcome to the world of tomorrow! Itâ€™s time to say goodbye to flatland, where pixels are bound to our lifeless screens, and embrace a reality where our world is the platform. It is the medium and the message. This reality is where digital comes to life, gets cozy with all of our senses, and augments our daily experiences.\r\n\r\nThis session will introduce concepts key to designing MR experiences. \r\n\r\nNote: MR refers to Mixed Reality and encompasses Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and everything in between."
