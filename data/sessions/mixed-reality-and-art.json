  "abstract": "This talk is about mixed reality technologies, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and how they can be beneficial to artists and exploring art in depth. I will go behind the code to the amazing things this technology currently does, what it can reveal and how it is currently being used for good and for ill. I will also discuss how easy it is to get off track on your project, as an artist or as a developer and what we need to bear in mind as we navigate the different streams of development and art\r\n\r\nI am an artist and a developer, and will be pitching this talk for people who are interested in both or who would like a new way to look at existing technologies to see the potential beneath. I speak with the experience of someone who has developed my own Augmented Reality applications and used it to create award winning art.\r\n\r\nThis talk brings value in terms of looking at the way we currently approach technologies as to how we could be approaching them and is a light and fun introduction to mixed and immersive reality options."
