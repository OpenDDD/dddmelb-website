  "abstract": "Everybody is talking about AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Analytics. It's hard to dismiss these. Many people, especially developers, are looking to move to the new data roles. However, many are faced with lots of fragmented information, too many courses, different platforms, and lots of tools. I have gone through this journey myself. Through some hard-work and some luck, I am currently a principal consultant for IoT and Analytics. In this session, I would like to take you on a journey to: 1) Demystify all the jargons and break them down into smaller, more concise, and simpler terms (AI, ML, IoT, Edge Computing, etc.)2) Explore the career options for developers moving to data roles? 3) What are the steps that you can take today to move into such roles? 4) What are the tools that you need to be equipped with for your new gigs? This is not a career-fair pitch. This is more to share my experience of what I have done, what worked and what did not. Finally, the hope is that you can benefit from the learning I have accumulated along the way."
