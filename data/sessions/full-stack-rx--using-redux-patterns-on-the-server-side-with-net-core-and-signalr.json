  "abstract": "Imagine you had something really important to tell everyone but weren't allowed to speak up until asked.\nThat's how all web servers and WebAPIs with their HTTP Request/Response cycle operate.\nSignalR, built on WebSockets, changes this client-server relationship from \"speak only when spoken to\" to a fully bi-directional communication.\nThis is amazing, but can also generate a lot of asynchronous events. Fortunately, we've got some great tools for handling asynchronous events....\n\nLike many developers, I first started using the Redux and Observable patterns developing client-side JavaScript / Typescript Single Page Apps.\nBut Rx and Redux libraries exist for many languages.\nThis talk explores implementing Redux behind a SignalR hub on an ASP.Net Core web server, adding predictable state management to the real-time capabilities of SignalR."
