  "abstract": "'Developer: A person that creates something’\r\n\r\nAs a developer, our daily task is to write code, create software for users to use, and get paid. Is that all? \r\n\r\nOur job has much more impact than that. It affects the end-users that use it, the team members that we work with, the people from other departments like Marketing and PR, the customers of the users that use it, people from the infrastructure side like AWS, etc. It makes a difference in the world, good or bad.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that when a customer does not think about the design of the product you developed but continues to use it-  then you have done a really amazing job. \r\n\r\nIn this session, I will explain the impact of our work as a developer, define and discover the sort of impact it has on the world, and how to leverage it. Hopefully, the talk will help you unlock the potential to do some truly great things and to have an even greater impact on the world as a developer."
