The secret to uncovering these problems is being a great listener.\r\n\r\nI will take you through the practical listening techniques I learned studying Behavioural Science and show to use them everyday with stakeholders and colleagues.\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll be able to immediately apply these listening skills and start having impactful conversations."
