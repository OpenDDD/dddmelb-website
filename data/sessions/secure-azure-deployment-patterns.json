In 2017 many organisations had breaches due to poor cloud deployment practices.\r\n\r\nIn this session, youâ€™ll learn how to use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to deploy resources in a secure manner. This session will look at Azure Storage, App Services, SQL, Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks.
