  "abstract": "In a dopamine driven world getting your next 'hit' can be easily done on social media and this can cause you to lose focus. On social media people from a diversity of backgrounds advertise their filtered life on social media and this can cause some negative impacts on their followers, even if they are not aware. We all have problems in life: family, financial, or legal. However posts on social media are often filtered so that the best things are shown. This is my story of how I became a better developer, a better listener, and did more with myself by reducing social media."
