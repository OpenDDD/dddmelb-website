This session is for devs who are curious to learn more about UX Research and Design, so you can work more effectively and collaboratively with your design peers. Join Laura for a crash course on UX terminology, methodologies and outputs, and we'll even squeeze in a few fun hands-on activities. Sharpen your sharpies, unbox the post-its, it's time to share the UX love!"
