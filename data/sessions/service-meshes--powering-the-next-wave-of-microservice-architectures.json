  "abstract": "Microservices and containers have transformed application design and deployment patterns. Modern cloud native architectures - which underpin many of the world's groundbreaking tech companies such as Uber, Netflix and Airbnb - afford unparalleled levels of agility and scale but are not without trade-offs. In applications comprising hundreds of services (and thousands of service instances), concerns such as security, operability and observability pose significant challenges. Supporting compensating capabilities such as circuit breakers, retry policies and service discovery in each microservice adds undesirable code bloat and impacts our ability to choose the best language for the problem at hand should the required libraries not be available. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will take an in-depth look at the service mesh pattern; the benefits that a decentralized microservice management approach brings; the best practices that have evolved; and most importantly what you need to know to effectively leverage a service mesh in your architecture:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of a service mesh for your application context. Don't just drink the cloud native Kool-Aid!\r\n- Disambiguate the overlapping responsibilities of an API gateway and service mesh in a modern architecture and demonstrate how they can be used in harmony.\r\n- How a service mesh enables choosing the best tool or language for a given service without being constrained by the availability of libraries for each platform. Effectively it's a weight loss plan for your microservices.\r\n- What techniques to apply when transitioning to a service mesh based architecture.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will take a hands-on look at what is involved to build and manage a microservice architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Istio, a leading open source service mesh. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning the service mesh pattern but also have the knowledge to put them into practice."
