We've made a decision to switch to the [Tito](https://ti.to) event management platform and [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) for secure payment processing.

      <p>Due to the popularity of last years event, we are running 2 separate ticket waves to give everyone an opportunity to obtain a ticket.<br/><br />
      Wave 1: Mon 07 May @ 12pm AEST <strong>(SOLD OUT)</strong><br/>
      Wave 2: Sat 02 June @ 3pm AEST</p>

    <a class="toggleAccordion" href="javascript:void(0);">How much is the event?</a>
    <div class="inner">
      <p>$79. The price will remain the same for both waves.</p>
      <p>In consultation with the community, this year's conference is seeing an increase in ticket pricing, because we want to do more things to make DDD Melbourne amazing.</p>
      <p>It is still exceptional value, and any proceeds will go straight back into the community.</p>
      <p>We’re dedicated to diversity, inclusion and even more so—equal opportunity. We realise that buying a ticket to a conference for many isn’t a trivial expense, but it can be a turning point in someone’s career.</p>
      <p>That's why we've launched our <a href="./opportunity-program">Opportunity Program</a>. We're committed to bringing in as many individuals who couldn’t attend otherwise as possible.

      <p>No - this year all payments will be via Stripe. It's vastly easier for us as organisers to only accept payments using Stripe, which currently doesn't allow payments to be made by Diners or rapper themed bitcoins. Please consider using Stripe with your own credit card, and claiming it back on expenses. The cost is low, so it should easily fall within your expenses limit!</p>
