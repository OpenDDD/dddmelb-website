One of the core tenets of DDD Melbourne is that the agenda is democratically selected. Session voting is the main mechanism that we employ to achieve that.

This means that you (collectively) have the power to decide on the agenda for the day.

In order to remove unconscious bias we implement anonymous session voting. This means that you will not see the details of the presenters and will need to vote based on the content. 

Each ticket holder is eligable to lodge 10 votes; we have a number of mechanisms in place to detect fraudulent votes. However you are also welcome to subsequently override your 10 votes at a later point.

<p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Please note:</strong> Our expectation of the community, <strong>and you as a voter</strong>, is that you will vote for a set of talks that make up <em>your</em> perfect agenda regardless of your friends' talks.<br><br>If you know who submitted any of the sessions we ask that you do not discuss it with anyone or post it on social media so we can retain a level playing field for all submitters through anonymity. We definitely want you to post and talk about the conference and encourage others to vote though so spread the word.<br><br> If we follow this approach as a community then we can be fair to all the submitters who have put time, effort and courage into crafting the amazing session proposals below.
