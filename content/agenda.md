I will go behind the code to the amazing things this technology currently does, what it can reveal and how it is currently being used for good and for ill. I will also discuss how easy it is to get off track on your project, as an artist or as a developer and what we need to bear in mind as we navigate the different streams of development and art</p>

                      I am an artist and a developer, and will be pitching this talk for people who are interested in both or who would like a new way to look at existing technologies to see the potential beneath. I speak with the experience of someone who has developed my own Augmented Reality applications and used it to create award winning art.</p>
                      <p>This talk brings value in terms of looking at the way we currently approach technologies as to how we could be approaching them and is a light and fun introduction to mixed and immersive reality options.</p></span>
                      <span class="bio"><p><em>J. Rosenbaum is a contemporary figurative artist working in 3D modeling and exploring the boundaries of technology and art. Their most recent work has been in exploring the nature of Non Binary Transness and their own genders and sexuality. Well known for being a painter of nudes, Rosenbaum has recently undertaken a masters degree and changed focus to more technologically based digital art using physics based rendering, Deep Neural Networks and Unity to develop an Augmented Reality mobile application.
                      Following a car accident that impaired Rosenbaum’s mobility they have turned their mind inwards exploring the nature of humanity, religion and gender through art. The human body has always been a source of fascination in Rosenbaum’s art with a focus on mythical and archaeological stories driving their progress. This fascination has continued with their newest Computer Generated works with a basis in classical art and history.

Accessibility in this context being how useable your website is to someone who has a permanent or temporary disability. It goes through the main types of disabilities and how these effect someones experience when accessing the web.
                      </p><p>
                      I then will go through some ways to test your website for accessibility and how to fix those problems you encounter. This is with some short code examples (junior level) and can also include a demo testing of a real live site.
                      </p><p>
                      The main focus is on the development side of accessibility, as that is where my experience is, but also from the UX, design and project management view point as well. As making a project accessible requires the whole team to work together,
                      </p><p>
                      By the end I expect my audience will have a better appreciation of how to more effectively design a website with accessibility in mind so more people can access it.</p></span>

                      That's how all web servers and WebAPIs with their HTTP Request/Response cycle operate.<br />
                      SignalR, built on WebSockets, changes this client-server relationship from "speak only when spoken to" to a fully bi-directional communication.<br />
                      This is amazing, but can also generate a lot of asynchronous events. Fortunately, we've got some great tools for handling asynchronous events....

                      Like many developers, I first started using the Redux and Observable patterns developing client-side JavaScript / Typescript Single Page Apps.<br />
                      But Rx and Redux libraries exist for many languages.<br />
                      This talk explores implementing Redux behind a SignalR hub on an ASP.Net Core web server, adding predictable state management to the real-time capabilities of SignalR.</p></span>

                      <span class="abstract"><p>Microservices and containers have transformed application design and deployment patterns. Modern cloud native architectures - which underpin many of the world's groundbreaking tech companies such as Uber, Netflix and Airbnb - afford unparalleled levels of agility and scale but are not without trade-offs. In applications comprising hundreds of services (and thousands of service instances), concerns such as security, operability and observability pose significant challenges. Supporting compensating capabilities such as circuit breakers, retry policies and service discovery in each microservice adds undesirable code bloat and impacts our ability to choose the best language for the problem at hand should the required libraries not be available. 
                      </p><p>
                      In this session, we will take an in-depth look at the service mesh pattern; the benefits that a decentralized microservice management approach brings; the best practices that have evolved; and most importantly what you need to know to effectively leverage a service mesh in your architecture:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>How to determine the suitability of a service mesh for your application context. Don't just drink the cloud native Kool-Aid!</li>
                      <li>Disambiguate the overlapping responsibilities of an API gateway and service mesh in a modern architecture and demonstrate how they can be used in harmony.</li>
                      <li>How a service mesh enables choosing the best tool or language for a given service without being constrained by the availability of libraries for each platform. Effectively it's a weight loss plan for your microservices.</li>
                      <li>What techniques to apply when transitioning to a service mesh based architecture.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Additionally, we will take a hands-on look at what is involved to build and manage a microservice architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Istio, a leading open source service mesh. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning the service mesh pattern but also have the knowledge to put them into practice.</p></span>

This is the story of how the VSTS team transformed from shipping an on-premise server product every couple of years, to shipping a cloud service multiple times a day. In the process, almost everything about how this team of 800 people work has changed. 
                      </p><p>
                      We had to figure out how to do agile at scale, how to transform into a microservice cloud architecture, complete restructure of teams and roles, threw out a suite of 10’s of thousands of tests and started over, went from almost 0 telemetry, to 8+TB/day and figuring out to do anything meaningful with all that data. Many mistakes were made along the way, and lessons learned that I’ll be sharing.</p></span>

But with more code running client side what changes do we need to make to how we write applications, test applications and secure applications?
                      </p><p>
                      So how do we write a secure SPA? What do we do with our security tokens, client-side data, track vulnerabilities in our dependencies or implement trust between the client and server?
                      </p><p>
                      In this talk, we'll deep dive into some practical solutions on how to create secure modern web applications.</p></span>

                      <span class="abstract"><p>Do you ever feel dirty when adding if statements and try catches to your code to handle basic errors, catch exceptions and/or log events?</p><p>
                      Maybe your code started off as a few basic lines but then blew up into a nested mess of branches after you handled every expected error. 
                      Or maybe you're envious of your functional programming friends and want to learn something new?
                      </p><p>
                      We've already seen the introduction of functional programming techniques when it comes to lists and events in procedural languages.
                      In this talk, I'll show you another technique functional programmers use to handle errors and how you can apply it yourself.

                      Popularised by Scott Wlaschin on his site F# for fun for profit. I bring the concept to C# with practical examples and an easy explanation
                      without the functional jargon. This technique has been battle tested and I'll gladly share the pros and cons as well as solutions to common situations you may face.
                      </p><p>
                      By the end of this talk, you'll be able to streamline your code to write clean, happy path programming where the business objective can be quickly understood.</p></span>
