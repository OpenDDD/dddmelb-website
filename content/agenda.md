                      <span class="abstract"><p>This session goes through the What, Why, Who, When and How's of accessibility in terms of a web development project. Accessibility in this context being how useable your website is to someone who has a permanent or temporary disability. It goes through the main types of disabilities and how these effect someones experience when accessing the web.
                      </p><p>
                      I then will go through some ways to test your website for accessibility and how to fix those problems you encounter. This is with some short code examples (junior level) and can also include a demo testing of a real live site.
                      </p><p>
                      The main focus is on the development side of accessibility, as that is where my experience is, but also from the UX, design and project management view point as well. As making a project accessible requires the whole team to work together,
                      </p><p>
                      By the end I expect my audience will have a better appreciation of how to more effectively design a website with accessibility in mind so more people can access it.</p></span>

                      <span class="abstract"><p>Git is an extremely popular tool in the software development world, but due to its sometimes confusing command line syntax and general reputation for being unfriendly, it can be difficult and intimidating for newer developers to learn and understand how to use it.
                      </p><p>
                      In this talk, I’ll explain how to use Git from the ground up. I’ll explain commits, branching, merging, rebasing, and maybe more, with lots of examples to show what’s really happening when you tell git to do something, and which situations you would use these commands in.
                      </p><p>
                      You’ll leave this talk not just knowing what Git is and what it does, but will also have an understanding of which commands will best solve the problems you might run into. You too can be “that developer who knows git”!</p></span>
                      <span class="bio"><p><em>I’m a software developer from Melbourne, currently working at PageUp.<br />
                      PageUp was my first job as a graduate, and in the three and a half years I've been there I’ve worked in both devops and on client facing webapps, gaining a bunch of experience in C# .NET, AWS, and AngularJS. When I started, I was mentored by a very friendly senior developer, which helped with my confidence and made me feel welcomed. I’ve tried to pass on that experience by mentoring new developers on my team, helping them learn and improve as they’re starting out.<br />
                      I've always wanted to try and expand that to helping other developers outside of my workplace, so I’ve become a part of Melbourne’s developer and meetup community, having regularly attended DDD Melbourne, presented at DDD by Night, and attended ALT.NET and OWASP meetups. If given the opportunity, presenting at DDD Melbourne will be another step along that path!</em></p></span>

                      <span class="abstract"><p>This talk is about mixed reality technologies, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and how they can be beneficial to artists and exploring art in depth. I will go behind the code to the amazing things this technology currently does, what it can reveal and how it is currently being used for good and for ill. I will also discuss how easy it is to get off track on your project, as an artist or as a developer and what we need to bear in mind as we navigate the different streams of development and art</p>
                      <p>
                      I am an artist and a developer, and will be pitching this talk for people who are interested in both or who would like a new way to look at existing technologies to see the potential beneath. I speak with the experience of someone who has developed my own Augmented Reality applications and used it to create award winning art.</p>
                      <p>This talk brings value in terms of looking at the way we currently approach technologies as to how we could be approaching them and is a light and fun introduction to mixed and immersive reality options.</p></span>
                      <span class="bio"><p><em>J. Rosenbaum is a contemporary figurative artist working in 3D modeling and exploring the boundaries of technology and art. Their most recent work has been in exploring the nature of Non Binary Transness and their own genders and sexuality. Well known for being a painter of nudes, Rosenbaum has recently undertaken a masters degree and changed focus to more technologically based digital art using physics based rendering, Deep Neural Networks and Unity to develop an Augmented Reality mobile application.
                      Following a car accident that impaired Rosenbaum’s mobility they have turned their mind inwards exploring the nature of humanity, religion and gender through art. The human body has always been a source of fascination in Rosenbaum’s art with a focus on mythical and archaeological stories driving their progress. This fascination has continued with their newest Computer Generated works with a basis in classical art and history.
