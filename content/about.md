DDD Melbourne is an inclusive non-profit conference for the software community

Our goal is to create an approachable event that appeals to the whole community, especially people that don't normally get to attend or speak at conferences. See our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

### What is Developer! Developer! Developer!?
DDD stands for Developer! Developer! Developer! 

Started in 2005 in the United Kingdom as a community conference organised by software developers for software developers. It's since spread all over the UK and Australia.

While it's heritage is a developer-focussed conference, DDD Melbourne is not just for developers, but for all professionals in the software industry.

DDD was set up with a number of key elements in mind, which hold true for all DDD conferences held worlwide:

-It is free / low cost
-It is on a Saturday
-An open submissions process
-A democratically chosen agenda
