DDD Melbourne is an inclusive non-profit conference for the software community

Our goal is to create an approachable event that appeals to the whole community, especially people who usually donâ€™t have the opportunity to attend, or speak at, conferences. See our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

### What is Developer! Developer! Developer!?
DDD stands for Developer! Developer! Developer! 

It started in 2005 in the United Kingdom as a community conference organised by software developers for software developers. It has since spread all over the UK and Australia.

While its heritage is as a developer-focussed conference, DDD Melbourne is not just for developers, but for all professionals in the software industry.

DDD was established with a number of key elements in mind, which hold true for all DDD conferences hosted worldwide. 

- It is free / low cost
- It is on a Saturday
- An open submissions process
- A democratically chosen agenda
