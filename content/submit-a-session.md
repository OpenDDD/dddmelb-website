We welcome sessions from any tech related topic. Previously we have had a wide range of sessions from Agile to Haskell, JavaScript to AWS, Microservices to UX. If voters or our in-house Panel think your session is relevant or interesting itâ€™s in!

This year will see the option of submitting a session to a private panel for selection. Not everyone wants to be in the spotlight of open submissions, we recognise this and provided an alternate pathway for speaker submissions. 

There will also be speaker training and support for all speakers, so first timers, Juniors, and the rest, are all encourage to submit and will have support!

Before submitting a session please consider the following:

- DDD Melbourne is an inclusive non-profit conference for the software community.
- We have an enforced code of conduct to ensure a friendly atmosphere.
- Flights and accommodation for speakers are not normally covered, but if that's a limitation that stops you from speaking then please let us know below and we'll reach out to discuss options.
- You will likely be speaking to an audience of between 50-150 people.
- You are welcome to submit a talk with a co-presenter or as a team. 
- Sessions are not a sales presentation although you are welcome to have a slide or two about yourself and your company
- You will probably have internet access, but you should have a backup plan in case it's unavailable.
- We will open voting to the event on Wednesday June 20. If your session gets voted in and you agree to present, then this is a serious commitment.
- You are welcome to submit more than one presentation, if you have multiple presentations that are voted in then we will either ask you to select one or select the highest voted talk to maximise the number of speaking opportunities we offer.
- Experienced presenter, Author & MVP Guy Smith Ferrier has some great advice on [how to give a great presentation](http://guysmithferrier.com/Downloads/HowToGiveGreatPresentations.pdf)
