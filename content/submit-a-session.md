We welcome sessions from any tech related topic. Previously we have had a wide range of sessions from Agile to Haskell, JavaScript to AWS, Microservices to UX. If voters or our in-house Panel think your session is relevant or interesting itâ€™s in!

Before submitting a session please consider the following:

- Sessions are not a sales presentation although you are welcome to have a slide or two about yourself and your company
- You will probably not have internet access
- We will open voting about a month prior to the event. If your session gets voted in and you agree to present, then this is a serious commitment
- Experienced presenter, Author & MVP Guy Smith Ferrier has some great advice on [how to give a great presentation](http://guysmithferrier.com/Downloads/HowToGiveGreatPresentations.pdf)
