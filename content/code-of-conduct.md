DDD Melbourne is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion.

**We do not tolerate harassment of *any* conference participants in *any* form.** Organisers will adhere to this code throughout all DDD Melbourne interactions at event venues, event-related social activities as well as social media. We expect the same cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.

Conference participants or anyone interacting with the event violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## Anti-harassment
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
- Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

**If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants.** This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference or related events with no refund.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

## Reporting
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be identified by pink t-shirts and you can familiarise yourself with our team [here](https://medium.com/ddd-melbourne/the-ddd-melbourne-crew-5f0dd3da09df). 

Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

## Anonymous report
You can [make an anonymous report here](https://goo.gl/forms/nxlw9ldDfJ06ohok2). We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

## Personal report

- Contacting a staff member, identified by pink t-shirts.
- Emailing us: [dddmelbourne@gmail.com](mailto:dddmelbourne@gmail.com)

When taking a personal report, [our staff](https://medium.com/ddd-melbourne/the-ddd-melbourne-crew-5f0dd3da09df) will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
